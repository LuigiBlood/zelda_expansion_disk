### Fix Recompiler Crash

**If the game crashes upon loading a disk save file, please do the following:**

To play the game on Recompiler mode for maximal performance, the following should be setup for the Ocarina of Time ROM:
 * **Edit the original game ROM settings.** There are two ways to access the game settings:
   * Launch the game, then on the menu bar, select Options, then Settings... _(or press Ctrl+T shortcut)_, and then select Config tab on the left side.
 * Select the Recompiler tab for the game settings.
 * **Make sure that Protect Memory is checked.** Reload the game, it should be fixed now.
